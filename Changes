        - initial public release
        - most core registers available
        - ability to change a single pin, a pin bank, or all pins at once
        - read(), write(), mode(), pullup() methods available for single pins,
          a pin bank and all pins
        - exposed register() and register_bits(), but these are more-or-less
          hidden in documentation and we advise they shouldn't really be used;
          they are a convenience for those who know how to understand IC
          registers
        - 5000+ tests
